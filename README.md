# MRI_Reliability

MRI litearture is asking an increasing number of reliability questions for [task fMRI](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620916786) and [resting state fMRI](www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116157). As attention to these questions increase, it is important to acknowledge the different methods to calculating reliability in fMRI, [as has been documents](www.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05446.x).

The purpose of this tool is to provide an open-source package that will provide multiple reliability metrics, at the group and individual level, that researchers can report with their manuscripts. At the individual level metrics, we plan to provide an `ICC` function that calculates ICC(1), ICC(2,1) or ICC(3,1), for description see discussion in (Liljequist et al., 2019)[www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219854]. In addition to the ICC, at the individual level we plan to provide a function to calculate the moment product correlation between sessions. At the group level, we plan to provide similarity calculations using Jaccard and Dice similarity coefficients. Since the Dice & Jaccard coefficients are biased by the threshold level between two images, we will provide an iterable approach to calculate the coefficients across a range of thresholds. Finally, for the Jaccard and Dice coefficients we will also include a permutation function that will allow inclusion of 2+ group level maps and calculate simiarlity coefficients for all coefficients.
