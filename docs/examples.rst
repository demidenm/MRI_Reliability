Example Usage
==============

The PyReliMRI package that hsa several scripts that are in are interrelated in some ways.

The examples that follow will build on each script to make their use (hopeful) more clear. The scripts can \
be categories into two groups:

* Similarity: `similarity.py` & `tetrachoric_correlation.py`
* Intraclass Correlation: `icc.py` & `brain_icc.py`

As such, the two categories will be discuss together and build on each other in the next sections.
