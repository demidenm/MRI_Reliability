============

The PyReliMRI package has several scripts that are interconnected.

The examples that follow will build on each script to make their use and utility more clear. The scripts can \
be categories into two groups:

* Similarity: `similarity.py` & `tetrachoric_correlation.py`
* Intraclass Correlation: `icc.py` & `brain_icc.py`

As such, the two categories will be discuss together and built on each other in the sections that follow.
