============

The PyReliMRI package has multiple modules that are interconnected.

The examples that follow will review each to make their use and utility more clear. The modules can \
be categories into two groups:

* Similarity: `similarity.py` & `tetrachoric_correlation.py`
* Intraclass Correlation: `icc.py` & `brain_icc.py`

As such, the two categories will be discuss together.
